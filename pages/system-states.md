# List of Current States

The following is a list of current states as defined in our HA configuration.yaml.



# What are States

Simply put, states are the various single or combination of household conditions.  An example of a state would be "all are home."  Another example would be "night time."  We could go crazy with the state of the household and micro-manage everything in sight, but the easiest approach is to keep states as broad as possible until there is a need for a very specific outcome as a result of a state, or combination thereof.

# Examples of General States

- A.M. and P.M.
- Night and Day
- Power Out, Power On
- Everyone is Home, Everyone is Away
- Lights are On, Lights are Off
- Morning, Noon, Night
- Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring
- Secured, Unsecured

# Examples of Specific States

- Jon is home but his car is not.
- Melanie is thirsty.
- There's no ice in the ice-maker and the bottle of Gin is empty.
