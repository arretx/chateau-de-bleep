# Introduction

I purchased this home back in 2002, long before anyone ever knew about the "Internet of Things."  It's a flat, foam rolled roof town-home built like a fortress.  Honestly, I thing the only vulnerability this home has is to plumbing corrosion.  All of the original wiring is aluminum except for the wires that have been added during its first remodel.
