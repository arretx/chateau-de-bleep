## All-Day Automations

### Grandfather Clock

The grandfather clock is designed to chime in like a traditional Grandfather Clock (_or a holiday-themed sound if the current day is a holiday_) every hour on the hour, with a single instance of a sound on the 1/2 hour.

#### Grandfather Clock Hour

- Every hour, on the hour no earlier than 8:30 A.M. and no late than 9:30 P.M., play the appropriate audio sound X number of times, where X is equal to the number of the hour.

#### Grandfather Clock Half Hour

- Every half hour, between the same time-frame as 'Grandfather Clock Hour', play an alternate sound one time.
